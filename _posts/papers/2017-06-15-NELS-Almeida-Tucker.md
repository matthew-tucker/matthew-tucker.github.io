#### Abstract

Agreement is typically assumed to be a core grammatical process which is legislated by universal grammatical processes, but famously goes awry in the erroneous acceptance of "agreement attraction" errors such as _The key to the cabinets are rusty from years of disuse_. These errors are well-documented in Germanic and Romance for unmarked singular subjects with marked plural non-subjects, but do not seem to occur as frequently when the subject is a marked plural and the distractor a unmarked singular. Using large-N self-paced reading data from Modern Standard Arabic, we demonstrate that agreement attraction is present for different phi-features in Arabic (gender and number) at different quantitative strengths. We also show that response-time distribution modeling can provide an insight into how markedness affects attraction: it is not that markedness gates whether attraction is present, but instead, agreement violations in Arabic do not furnish the response time distributional context required for attraction when grammatical subjects bear marked morphological features. These two pieces of evidence combine to suggest a theory of agreement that is rooted in the differential activity of phi-features (Ã  la intervention theories of the Person Case Constraint) and a privative theory of grammatical gender and number. Finally, we suggest that attraction be viewed as an error-driven recovery strategy, in line with recent research on working memory implementations of syntactic theory.
