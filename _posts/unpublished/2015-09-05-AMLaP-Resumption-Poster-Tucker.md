#### Summary

This poster describes two Likert-style acceptability studies which use the experimental design of the studies reported in [Sprouse, Wagers, & Phillips (2012)](http://muse.jhu.edu/article/469088)	and [Sprouse, Caponigro, Greco, & Cecchetto (In Press)](http://www.sprouse.uconn.edu/papers/Italian.islands.pdf) to examine the relationship between resumption and island extractions in Modern Standard Arabic. The results suggest that Modern Standard Arabic shows a strong preference for resumption with <span class="construct">d-linked</span> fillers, with speakers heavily dispreferring resumption when the _wh_-filler is bare (_who_, especially). However, when a d-linked filler is present, the presence of a resumptive pronoun in the gap position of _wh_-dependency ameliorates a large portion of the island effect seen in the acceptability measures. In the terminology of Sprouse, Wagers, & Phillips (2012), the resumptive pronoun appears to ameliorate the super-additive/grammatical component of the island violation, only.
