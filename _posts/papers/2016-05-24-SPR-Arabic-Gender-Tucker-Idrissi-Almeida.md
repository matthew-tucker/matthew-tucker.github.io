#### Abstract

Previous work on the comprehension of agreement has shown that, in many languages, incorrectly inflected verbs do not trigger responses typically seen with fully ungrammatical verbs when the preceding sentential context furnishes a possibly matching distractor noun. Four studies are presented which tested the character and timing of these errors in comprehension along the dimensions of grammatical gender and number in Modern Standard Arabic. Despite a robust verbal gender system which interacts with other inflectional features, Arabic readers show agreement attraction effects in reading comprehension for gender and number on verbs given appropriate preceding contexts with mismatching NPs. However, we also observe that these two features do not behave identically either qualitatively or quantitatively. Qualitatively, attraction for gender is not subject to markedness considerations which lead to asymmetries in attraction relative to feature combinations in the preceding NPs, yet number is subject to these asymmetries. Quantitatively, the size of gender effects are smaller and later relative to number attraction effects. These results are shown to require changes to representation and process theoretical models of agreement attraction. We also discuss how models of agreement errors require modifications in order to account for these differential results.

#### Notes

This is a draft version of a paper currently under review. Please drop me a line if you intend on citing it. The claims it in it may ultimately supersede [our poster from AMLaP in 2015](/files/prepubs/amlap-2015-tucker-idrissi-almeida.pdf).
