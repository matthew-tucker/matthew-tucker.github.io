#### Summary

This talk provides an argument that the complement of the Maltese (Semitic; Republic of Malta) verb _ġiegħel_, "to cause" is tenseless yet requires an inflected embedded verb, in line with the general typological property that Arabic and Maltese, unlike Hebrew, lack a morphological infinitive. I provide several arguments that there are no morphological, semantic, or syntactic correlates of tense or aspect in the complement of _ġiegħel_, nor is the thematic agent of the embedded verb marked structurally nominative. Despite this, full subject agreement is required in this embedded clause. I develop a <span class="construct">Disjunctive Case</span> approach to this phenomenon (Marantz, 1993) which takes case assignment to be postsyntactic yet agreement to be syntactic. The result is a coherent analysis of Maltese embedded verbs which allows subject agreement to be valued in the absence of both nominative case and φ-complete Tense.

#### Notes

This is a talk version of chapter 3 of [my dissertation from UCSC](/files/papers/dissertation.pdf) and is exists in a slightly longer format as [an unpublished squib](/files/papers/maltese-case-and-agreement.pdf). Please cite the squib or dissertation if you wish to refer to this argumentation.
