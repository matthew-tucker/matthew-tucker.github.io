#### Abstract

Two acceptability experiments are presented which assess whether resumptive pronouns freely alternate with gaps and/or ameliorate island violation effects in wh-questions in Modern Standard Arabic. Both experiments test Complex Noun Phrase Constraint violations, adjunct island violations, and whether is- land violations. The results indicate that resumption is largely only acceptable with structurally complex DP fillers (which-NP) and is generally preferred to gapped structures in long-distance dependencies. Resumption is also shown to ameliorate the grammatical component of some island violations (adjunct and whether islands), but in different quantitative amounts across different islands.

#### Notes

This is a draft version of a paper currently under review. Please drop me a line if you intend on citing it. The claims it in it may ultimately supersede [our poster from AMLaP in 2015](amlap-2015-tucker-idrissi-sprouse-almieda.pdf).
