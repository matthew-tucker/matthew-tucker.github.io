# Personal Information

## Before Now

I was born in Gainesville, Florida and moved around a bit &mdash; notably with a stint in the greater Cincinnati area leading to a longstanding support of the [Cincinnati Reds](http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/) &mdash; before ending up in a small town near Madison, Wisconsin. During my time in south central Wisconsin I spent some time as a member of both the (now-defunct) [Capital Sound](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC8699897E1FFA9B6) and [Madison Scouts](http://www.madisonscoutslive.com/mainsite/) Drum and Bugle Corps (I played the tuba/contrabass). At Cornell University I was a member of the [Cornell University Big Red Bands](http://www.bigredbands.org/), where I served as both Marching Band Drum Major and Pep Band Conductor for one season. I remain a fan of [Drum Crops International](http://dci.org/) and marching bands to this day.
