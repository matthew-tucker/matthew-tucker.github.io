#### Summary

This is a handout of a talk given at the 2010 Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America by Robert Henderson (primary author) and me. In it, we provide a morphophonological analysis of the K'ichee' (Mayan; Guatemala) status suffixes (_e.g._, /-ik/) in the Distributed Morphology framework. Specifically, we argue that Vocabulary Insertion is at least partially sensitive to the output of prosodic phrase building operations, allowing us to claim that status suffix allomorphy is sensitive to intonational phrase boundaries.

#### Notes

Robert solo-authored a [2011 NLLT Paper](http://rhenderson.net/resources/papers/intonational.pdf) ([NLLT link](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11049-012-9170-8)) which develops the core empirical insights concerning the status suffixes in the context of an Optimality-Theoretic analysis. That paper should be consulted for any generalizations you wish to draw about K'ichee' or the status suffixes.
