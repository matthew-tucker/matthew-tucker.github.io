		<h3>Theoretical Morphosyntax</h3>
		
		My research is theoretically focused on the interface between principles of syntax and their morphophonological expression. This is in part grounded by my empirical commitment to Afroasiatic languages but also by the belief that a properly formulated morphology reduces the explanatory burden placed on syntax. Previously, these interests have found expression in work on the morphology of local anaphora (the so-called <span class="construct">Anaphor Agreement Effect</span>), the syntax of morphologically complex verbs, and the syntax of clitics.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<h3>Afroasiatic (Semitic) Languages</h3>
		
		My pre-linguistics background is in Arabic specifically and Afroasiatic languages more generally. I have done fieldwork on varieties of spoken vernacular Arabic (Egyptian, Palestinian, and Moroccan), Maltese, and Berber. All my work attempts to use deeply descriptive data from these languages to further theoretical understanding. To date I have worked on documenting both ellipsis processes (specifically, <span class="construct">Verb-Stranding Verb Phrase Ellipsis</span>) and restrictions on clitic clusters in Maltese and Arabic (which I analyze as a variant of the <span class="construct">Person-Case Constraint</span>).
		</p>

		<h3>Syntax/Prosody Interactions</h3>
		
		My empirical commitment to Semitic morphosyntax makes ignoring prosodic concerns impossible. I have also published some on the morphophonology of Iraqi Arabic verbs. My work on the syntax of verbal morphology in Arabic is also influenced by this thread, and I am always looking for ways to unify the findings of phonologists working on word-level prosody and syntacticians working on head-movement and verbal inflection. This work has been nurtured by my involvement in the Stanford-UCSC research group <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~gribanov/CrISP.html" target="_blank">Crosslinguistic Investigations in Syntax-Prosody</a>.
		</p>

		<h3>Experimental Morphosyntax and Sentence Processing</h3>
		
		Recently, I have become interested in the real-time processing of morphology and syntax, furthered by my work in the <a href="http://linglabs.org" target="_blank">UCSC Linguistics Labs</a>. To date this work has been focused entirely on the processing of agreement and reflexives in American English (with <a href="http://people.ucsc.edu/~mwagers/" target="_blank">Matt Wagers</a>). After leaving UCSC, this work has shifted to an emerging interest in the neuroscience of language, based upon my participation in the <a href="http://nyuad.nyu.edu/research/centers-institutes/neuro-language-lab.html" target="_blank">NYUAD Neuroscience of Language Lab</a>.
