#### Summary

This is a handout of a talk given at the [Seventh Brussels Conference on Generative Linguistics](http://www.crissp.be/events/program-2/) as a keynote. In it, I outline a novel instance of the **Person Case/_me-lui_ Constraint** in Maltese (Semitic; Republic of Malta). I also provide several arguments that, in this language, at least some verbs instantiate argument structures in which the accusative theme asymmetrically c-commands the dative goal/recipient. The result is argued to be a system in which **Agree**-based approaches to the PCC ([Nevins, 2007](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11049-006-9017-2); [BÃ©jar & Rezac, 2009](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ling.2009.40.1.35)) make incorrect predictions and a morphological approach is required, instead. Along the way, I theoretically develop the notion that strong pronouns in Semitic are a combination of an accusative pronoun plus a morphologically empty host.

#### Notes

This talk was superseded by chapter 5 of [my dissertation](/files/papers/dissertation.pdf), and that should be consulted for more details on the Maltese PCC as well as its relationship to the other documented PCC in Semitic (from Modern Standard Arabic).
