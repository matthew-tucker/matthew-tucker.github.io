  <p class="post-content">My name is Matt Tucker, and I am an Assistant Professor of Linguistics at Oakland University in Rochester, MI. My research focuses on syntactic theory &mdash; both experimental and formal &mdash; as well as the Semitic languages (esp. Arabic and Maltese). I also blog a bit about language and fencing.</p>
  
  <p class="post-content">(This website makes some use of Arabic and Maltese fonts. Maltese is usually fine for most modern operating systems, but if you see boxes or gibberish, you likely need <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Arabic" target="_blank">support for Arabic text</a>).</p>
