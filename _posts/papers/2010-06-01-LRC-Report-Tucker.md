#### Abstract

This paper reports a speeded acceptability judgment task which assess the presence or absence of agreement attraction effects (_i.e._, _the key to the cabinets are_...) in nonfinite complement TPs in English. We report a reduced ability to discriminate grammaticality from ungrammaticality in the presence of mismatching NPs preceding the infinitival verb (_e.g._, _The decision to fail the students were difficult for the young teacher_).

#### Notes

This paper was written as part of a fellowship I held in 2009 with what later became known as the [UCSC Syntax, Semantics, and Language Processing Lab](http://people.ucsc.edu/~jpguevar/slab.html).
