#### Summary

This is a handout of an invited talk given at the fourth installment of the _Roots_ series of workshops, held at NYU in the summer of 2015. In it I provide an analysis of the Modern Standard Arabic derivational verbal system and deverbal nominal system in the framework of Distributed Morphology (DM), examining the consequences of this data for a version of DM which assumes [Embick's (2011)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/localism-versus-globalism-morphology-and-phonology) **Linearization Hypothesis on Vocabulary Insertion** (or: the C<sub>1</sub>-LIN Theory). Two major consequences of this approach are shown to be that: (1) nonconcatenative templatic morphology is analyzable as underlyingly linear and (2) the 'little-_x_' categorizing heads of DM cannot be phasal/cyclic in the sense of rendering their complements opaque to further morphological visibility.


#### Notes

This talk involves some elements of an analysis of the Arabic clause put forth in [my paper in a _Festschrift_ for Jorge Hankamer](). Full argumentation for some of the assumptions left unproven in the handout appear there.
