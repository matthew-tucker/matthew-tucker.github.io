#### Abstract

The Anaphor Agreement Effect (AAE; Rizzi 1990) is a phenomenon occasionally documented whereby reflexive and reciprocal elements cannot control otherwise expected verbal agreement. I argue that the AAE should be properly restricted to only some of the cases documented in the literature and properly understood as applicable only to verbal, not adjectival, agreement. I discuss the case of small clause predicative adjectives in Romance, which appear to show agreement with a reflexive element. The resulting picture is one in which the AAE is applicable to **Agree** only, and not that morphology typically taken to be concord. I adopt a proposal for an operation **Concord** slightly modified from Norris (2014) and show how this not only accounts for the AAE and the associated adjectival facts, but also a particularly recalcitrant example of putative object agreement with the French reflexive clitic _se_.

#### Notes

This is an expanded version of my second qualifying paper from UC Santa Cruz.
