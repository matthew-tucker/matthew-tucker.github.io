#### Summary

This poster describes two masked priming experiments meant to assess a residual fact from our [Frontiers paper on agreement in Arabic](http://journal.frontiersin.org/researchtopic/1545/encoding-and-navigating-linguistic-representations-in-memory). In that paper, we observed that broken/ablauting plural nouns do not show two of the hallmarks of plurality in sentence-level reading times, whereas sound/suffixing plurals do. Here we used visual masked priming to assess whether this was a property of lexical access or sentence-level reading. RTs to lexical decision tasks shows no difference in strength of priming effects between broken/ablauting and sound/suffixing plurals, regardless of whether the singular form primes the plural or vice-versa. We conclude that the effect in our _Frontiers_ paper must be a result of sentence-level processing considerations.
