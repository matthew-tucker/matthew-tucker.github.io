#### Summary

One of the constitutive properties of the Semitic languages is their lack of full character orthographic segments for short vowels, which are instead represented with diacritic marks. Despite being available as diacritics, in both Arabic and Hebrew these diacritics are hardly ever used, being retained largely only for (1) language learners, (2) religious texts/poetry, or (3) morphological disambiguation of ambiguous strings. Here we report twop masked priming experiments which investigate this effect by examining whether primes with vowels facilitate the processing of targets without vowels and vice-versa. Our results suggest that form ambiguity (_modulo_ the diacritics) does not slow processing, but the addition of superfluous or otherwise unused diacritics actually _inhibits_ lexical access/single word reading.
