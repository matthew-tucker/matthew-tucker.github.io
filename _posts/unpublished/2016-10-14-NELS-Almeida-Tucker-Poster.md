#### Summary

This poster presents two quantitative approaches to modeling the effect sizes and reaction time distribution of agreement attraction errors in comprehension in Modern Standard Arabic. In this poster, we address two assumptions normally made in the agreement attraction literature: (1) that simple agreement errors (without a distractor) are uniform with attraction errors (where a distractor is present) and (2) that all agreement features contribute to attraction equally. Using Principle Components Analysis on a large-N self-paced reading experiment, we demonstrate that: (a) agreement errors (with or without an attractor) involve a heavy right tail of the reaction time distribution, (b) this heavy right tail disappears in classical agreement attraction contexts, and (c) when the subject of a sentence bears a _marked_ agreement feature, this heavy right tail never appears. This leads to the conclusion that simple agreement errors are modulated by markedness of the subject's agreement features, removing the precondition for attraction to obtain. We also show that different agreement features (gender and number) trigger different amounts of illusory licensing, measured in the size of the reading time facilitation to erroneously accepted ungrammatical sentences in Arabic.
