# Personal Information

## Before Now

I was born in Gainesville, Florida and moved around a bit &mdash; notably with a stint in the greater Cincinnati area &mdash; before ending up in a small town near Madison, Wisconsin. During my time in south central Wisconsin I spent some time as a member of both the (now-defunct) [Capital Sound](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC8699897E1FFA9B6) and [Madison Scouts](http://www.madisonscoutslive.com/mainsite/) Drum and Bugle Corps (I played the tuba/contrabass). At Cornell University I was a member of the [Cornell University Big Red Bands](http://www.bigredbands.org/), where I served as both Marching Band Drum Major and Pep Band Conductor for one season. I remain a fan of [Drum Crops International](http://dci.org/) and marching bands to this day.


## Now

Outside of work I basically only have time for fencing. I am a [sabreur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabre_(fencing)), a former member of [MK Fencing Academy](http://mkfencingacademy.com/) in Dubai, and a current member of [Renaissance Fencing Club](http://www.renaissancefencing.com/) in Troy, MI. I'm a licensed referee in all three fencing weapons and volunteer as a referee in my spare time. I also [do a bit of running](http://moa2h3.org/) when I have the time.



## Family 

My [wife, Bern Samko](https://sites.google.com/site/bsamko/) is also a linguist (and former [Jeopardy! contestant](http://www.j-archive.com/showplayer.php?player_id=6633)), also at OU. My [brother, Raymond](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raymond_Tucker) is a research clinical psychologist working on suicide risk assessment and prevention. My [cousin, Nicole](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Nicole&lname=Matera) is an ultramarathon runner and can run a great deal farther than most people reading this page.
