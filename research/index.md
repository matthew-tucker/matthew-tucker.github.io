# Research Interests

## Grammar, Memory, and Parsing

> How are grammatical representations used in language comprehension and/or production?

I am interested in the ways in which grammatical principles are used by speakers and comprehenders of language in real-time. I use experimental methodologies to determine to when and how linguistic representations play a role in determining behavior in parsing. This involves questioning how linguistic representations are stored in and retrieved from memory, as well as how predictions are made for upcoming structure. In this domain I have been most concerned with the processing of <span class="construct">dependencies</span> --- relationships between words that hold over a distance.

## Theoretical Mophology

> What are the primitive units and operations which constitute words?

Much of my theoretical work touches on the internal composition of words &mdash; both those that obviously contain multiple parts and those which initially appear un-decomposable. In this domain, the questions which I ask tend to be about the nature of morphological representation (what are the proper primitives of word-formation?) and morphological process (what are the operations which build words? Are they distinct form the operations which build phrases?). Much of my work in this domain has been conducted inside the framework of [<span class="construct">Distributed Morhology</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_morphology), but I am also interested in delineating the relationship between morphology and phonology using [<span class="construct">Optimality Theory</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimality_theory).

## Theoretical Syntax

> How are relationships between words represented in the grammar of human languages?

My graduate training was largely in formal syntax, and many questions about the nature of syntactic theory remain present in my work. In this domain I am especially interested in the theoretical nature of agreement and its cross-linguistic typology.
