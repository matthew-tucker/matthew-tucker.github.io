# Personal Information

## Before Now

I was born in Gainesville, Florida and moved around a bit &mdash; notably with a stint in the greater Cincinnati area &mdash; before ending up in a [small town near Madison, Wisconsin](http://www.marshall-wi.com/). During my time in south-central Wisconsin I spent some time as a member of both the (now-defunct) [Capital Sound](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC8699897E1FFA9B6) and (not-defunct) [Madison Scouts](http://www.madisonscoutslive.com/mainsite/) Drum and Bugle Corps (I played the tuba/contrabass). At Cornell University I was a member of the [Cornell University Big Red Bands](http://www.bigredbands.org/), where I served as both Marching Band Drum Major and Pep Band Conductor for one season.

## Now

Outside of work I basically only have time for fencing. I am a [sabreur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabre_(fencing)), a former member of [MK Fencing Academy](http://mkfencingacademy.com/) in Dubai, and a current member of (and assistant coach at) [Renaissance Fencing Club](http://www.renaissancefencing.com/) in Troy, MI. I'm a [licensed referee](https://foc.askfred.net/Referee/refDetail.php?ref_id=7671) in all three fencing weapons and work as a national sabre referee in my spare time. Finally, I am the current Secretary of the [Michigan Division of USA Fencing](http://www.michfencing.net/index.php).

## Family 

My wife, Bern Samko, is also a linguist (and former [Jeopardy! contestant](http://www.j-archive.com/showplayer.php?player_id=6633)), now at [Appen](http://appen.com/). My [brother, Raymond](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raymond_Tucker) is an assistant professor of psychology at LSU working on suicide risk assessment and prevention.
