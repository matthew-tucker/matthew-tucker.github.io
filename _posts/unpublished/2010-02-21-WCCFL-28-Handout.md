#### Summary

This is a handout of a talk given at the 28*th* Annual Meeting of the West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics which attempts to derive the entirety of the Iraqi Arabic verbal root-and-pattern system using an input set containing only a consonantal root and vocalic melody. It is a portion of my MA thesis from UC Santa Cruz. Templatic effects are derived solely by phonotactic and syllabic constraints in the language at large. The resulting system is called the **Root and Pattern** system for nonconcatenative templatic morphology.

#### Notes

This handout led to the published [WCCFL Proceedings Paper]() as well as an [article in Recherches linguistique de Vincennes](). The paper version, in particular, is a better-packaged version of this project.
