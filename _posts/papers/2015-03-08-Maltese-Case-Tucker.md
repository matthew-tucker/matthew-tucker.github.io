#### Abstract

Structural case and syntactic agreement were historically taken to be tightly connected in the syntactic architecture, with many formal theories assuming that valuation of one leads to assignment of the other. Since Marantz (1993), however, momentum has slowly been building for approaches that de-link these elements. Here I provide an analysis of reduced-clause complement constructions in Maltese (Semitic; Republic of Malta) that yields a novel argument for this dissociation. I show that complements to verbs like _ġiegħel_, "to cause/force" show no evidence of structural nominative case yet still show fully inflected subject agreement on the embedded predict. I develop a Disjunctive Case (Marantz, 1993) approach to this issue which treats the case assignment as a postsyntactic phenomenon, allowing agreement valuation to proceed on solely syntactic terms.

This is a short squib derived from chapter 3 of [my doctoral dissertation](/files/papers/dissertation.pdf).
